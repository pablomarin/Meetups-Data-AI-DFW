It is supported on Windows 2016, or the Ubuntu Data Science Virtual Machine and shares the same core VM images (and hence all the rich toolset) as the DSVM. We also provide end-to-end AI samples for image and text understanding. The deep learning virtual machine also makes the rich set of tools and samples on the DSVM more easily discoverable.
